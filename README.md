Me & Doctor — Frontend (Phase 1 MVP)
React/Vite frontend for the Me & Doctor (Clinic OS) product — a true clinic operating system for solo doctors and small clinics with one assistant.
Setup
npm install
cp .env.example .env   # set VITE_API_BASE_URL to the Railway backend URL
npm run dev
Deploy to Vercel, same pattern as Me & Coach. Set VITE_API_BASE_URL explicitly in the Vercel project's build environment variables — a missing value fails loudly at startup (src/lib/api.js) instead of silently returning HTML 404s, the bug hit during Me & Coach's launch.
Design system
Tokens are drawn directly from the Me & Doctor logo (brass gold + ink navy on warm cream):
Colors: cream #FAF6EE background, ink #16233D text/nav, brass #B8935A accent, sage/clay for status
Type: Fraunces (display, token numbers, clinic name), Inter (UI), Noto Sans Tamil (Tamil labels — this is a Tamil-first product, not an English product with Tamil translations bolted on)
Signature element: every card ('.chit' class in src/index.css) reads as a clinic paper artifact — a token chit, a prescription slip — with a torn/perforated bottom edge, instead of a generic rounded card.
Structure
src/hooks/useAuth.jsx — phone+OTP session, token in localStorage
src/hooks/useClinicData.js — one hook per domain: clinic, patients (name/mobile/token search), patient detail (full timeline), visits, prescriptions, queue (15s polling), billing, reports
src/pages/Dashboard.jsx — today's patients, walk-ins, completed visits, pending payments, today's revenue, recent patients, upcoming follow-ups
src/pages/Queue.jsx — waiting → in_consultation → completed, plus cancel
src/pages/Patients.jsx — registration (full profile) + search by name/mobile/token
src/pages/PatientDetail.jsx — the complete patient timeline (visits, prescriptions, bills, follow-ups) + the new-visit workflow (chief complaint → diagnosis → prescription with advice → billing), all on one page since that's the actual daily flow a doctor works through
src/pages/Billing.jsx — itemized fees, payment status, mark-as-paid
src/pages/Reports.jsx — 7-day collection/patient trend, pending payments list
src/pages/Settings.jsx — full clinic settings
Phase 1 MVP — complete
Every page above reflects the fully approved Phase 1 MVP feature set: complete patient registration, full patient timeline (visits/diagnosis/prescriptions/bills/follow-ups/payments), chief-complaint-driven visit workflow, prescription with advice + print + WhatsApp share (ready, pending Wati template approval), search by mobile/name/token, 4-state queue, itemized billing with invoice numbers, a real stats dashboard, complete clinic settings, and basic reports.
Deliberately out of scope (explicit decisions, not oversights)
Staff/Assistant role (single doctor login only)
Appointment booking (walk-in queue only)
Offline-first
Multi-location support
Production hardening pass (post-audit)
src/pages/Onboarding.jsx — new. The previously-missing doctor onboarding screen: phone+OTP verify (same widget as Login) → clinic details form → account created and logged in.
src/hooks/useMsg91Widget.js — new. Extracted the MSG91 widget loading/send/verify logic out of Login.jsx into a shared hook, reused by both Login.jsx and Onboarding.jsx. Fixes two bugs found in the audit: the widget-ready state is now real React state that actually gates the Send OTP button (previously a ref was set but never read), and both send/verify now check MSG91's response.type instead of only reacting to thrown exceptions.
src/pages/Queue.jsx — each token now has an "Open Consultation" link straight into that patient's visit form in PatientDetail.jsx. Previously the queue and the visit workflow were disconnected — a doctor had to separately search Patients to do anything.
src/pages/PatientDetail.jsx — added the Lab/Test Recommendations field, and payment-history entries now link directly to their invoice PDF.
src/hooks/useAuth.jsx — removed the dead sendOtp/verifyOtp functions (nothing called them since the Widget flow replaced them), added onboard().
Android app (Capacitor)
This web app is also packaged as a native Android app via Capacitor, for Play Store distribution — same codebase, no forked architecture. See CAPACITOR_SETUP.md for the full setup, build, signing, and Play Store submission guide. Quick reference:
npm run cap:add:android — one-time, generates the android/ project (run locally, needs the Android SDK)
npm run build:android — rebuilds the web app and syncs it into the native project (run this after any frontend change, before testing in Android Studio)
npm run cap:open:android — opens the project in Android Studio
