Me & Doctor — Capacitor / Android / Play Store Setup
This wraps the existing Me & Doctor web app (unchanged) as a native Android app. No backend, architecture, or feature changes — this is packaging only.
App ID: com.ungakadai.medoctor App Name: Me & Doctor
1. Prerequisites (install these locally — not needed in this repo)
Node.js 18+ (you already have this, for the existing web build)
Android Studio (latest stable) — https://developer.android.com/studio
JDK 17 — Android Studio bundles a compatible JDK; use its bundled one unless you already have JDK 17 set up
An Android device (USB debugging on) or an Android Studio emulator, for testing
You do not need any of this to keep developing/deploying the web app on Vercel as before — this is purely additive.
2. One-time setup (run these locally, in order)
# 1. Install the new Capacitor dependencies (already added to package.json)
npm install

# 2. Build the web app once — Capacitor wraps the built output (dist/),
#    not the source files directly
npm run build

# 3. Generate the native Android project.
#    THIS STEP NEEDS TO BE RUN ON YOUR MACHINE — it requires network
#    access and the Android SDK, neither of which are available in
#    the environment that generated this zip, so the android/ folder
#    is NOT included yet. This command creates it.
npm run cap:add:android

# 4. Generate all Android icon/splash sizes from the prepared source
#    images (resources/icon.png, resources/splash.png — already
#    included in this zip, derived from your existing logo).
npm run cap:assets

# 5. Sync the built web app + icons into the native project
npm run cap:sync
After this, you'll have a full android/ folder — a real Android Studio project.
3. Opening and running the app
npm run cap:open:android
This opens the android/ folder in Android Studio. From there:
Click Run (▶) with a device/emulator selected to install and launch the app
The app loads your Vite build and talks to your deployed Railway backend over HTTPS exactly like the web version — there's no local dev server involved
Whenever you change frontend code, rebuild and re-sync before testing in Android Studio again:
npm run build:android
(This is vite build && cap sync android in one step — already in package.json.)
4. Project-specific configuration to check before building
.env — make sure VITE_API_BASE_URL points at your production Railway backend before running npm run build for anything you intend to actually install on a device. Capacitor bundles whatever was built; there's no way to change this at runtime like a website's env can be.
Backend CORS — your backend's FRONTEND_URL env var (Railway) currently allowlists your Vercel domain. The Android app serves itself from https://localhost (set via androidScheme: 'https' in capacitor.config.ts). Add it to the allowlist:
FRONTEND_URL=https://me-and-doctor-frontend.vercel.app,https://localhost
MSG91 OTP Widget — no changes needed. It loads over HTTPS via a <script> tag same as the web version, and Android's default network security config allows this without extra configuration since everything here is already HTTPS (no cleartext HTTP anywhere in this app).
Internet permission — Capacitor's Android template includes the INTERNET permission by default, required for every API call this app makes. Nothing to add manually.
5. Building a release APK/AAB for the Play Store
5a. Generate a signing key (once, keep this safe forever)
keytool -genkey -v -keystore me-and-doctor-release.keystore -alias medoctor -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000
Store the resulting .keystore file and its passwords somewhere secure (password manager, not committed to git — already excluded via .gitignore). If you lose this, you can never update the app again under the same listing — Google Play requires the same signing key for every update.
5b. Configure signing in Android Studio
In android/app/build.gradle, add a signingConfigs block referencing your keystore (Android Studio's Build → Generate Signed Bundle/APK wizard can do this for you interactively the first time, and will write the config for you).
5c. Build the release bundle
Play Store requires an AAB (Android App Bundle), not a raw APK:
Android Studio: Build → Generate Signed Bundle / APK → Android App Bundle
Or via CLI: cd android && ./gradlew bundleRelease
The output .aab file is what you upload to Play Console.
(An APK is still useful for direct device testing/sideloading: Build → Generate Signed Bundle / APK → APK.)
6. Play Store submission checklist
[ ] Google Play Developer account (one-time $25 registration fee)
[ ] App icon — already generated from resources/icon.png in step 2
[ ] Feature graphic (1024×500) — not auto-generated, design this separately for the Play Store listing page
[ ] Screenshots of the app (phone-size, at least 2) — capture these from Android Studio's emulator running the built app
[ ] Short description (≤80 chars) and full description for the listing
[ ] Privacy Policy URL — required by Play Store even for a clinic-internal tool, since the app handles patient data. Host a simple policy page (can be a plain page on your own domain) before submitting
[ ] Data safety form (Play Console) — declare what data the app collects (patient records, phone numbers for OTP) and confirm it's stored securely (Supabase + RLS, already true of this backend)
[ ] Content rating questionnaire (Play Console)
[ ] Target API level — Capacitor 6's Android template targets a current API level by default; Play Store rejects apps targeting outdated levels, so keep Android Studio/SDK tools updated before your first submission
7. Troubleshooting
White screen on launch — almost always VITE_API_BASE_URL wasn't set correctly at build time, or the build wasn't re-synced after a code change. Re-run npm run build:android.
Network requests failing only on Android, not on web — check the CORS FRONTEND_URL note in section 4; https://localhost must be in the allowlist.
OTP widget not loading — check that the device/emulator actually has internet access; the widget script loads externally same as on web.
cap add android fails — usually a missing/misconfigured Android SDK path. Open Android Studio once first (lets it finish its own first-run SDK setup), then retry.
